## System Deployment and Configurations
![](UMLDiagram/DeploymentDiagram.png)  
In back-end we have our Java EE artifact in tomcat server which connects to MySQL database in the same Linux server.  
In fore-end, Google Chrome browser needs to be installed in client machine, and add our extension in it.   
User can view the system via web pages and the extension window. Web pages are provided by **JSP pages** which deployed in tomcat server, while the extension communicates with back-end via **ajax HTTP request**, and the server responses data in `JSON` format (See also <a href="#appendix-3-api-list">API list</a> in appendix). The extension is built with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.

## System Architecture
### Package Diagram
![](UMLDiagram/architecture.png)  
The architecture of GoCheer server is clear and not sophisticated.  
We use JDBC to connect to our MySQL server, and use **Hibernate ORM** to map our database schema to classes in **Entity**.  
We encapsulated all **CRUD** and other operation which conserns Hibernate or database in our **DAO** package, so other layers can consider about the logic only.  
In **webAPP** we have all our servlets and filter to process requests, and we have JSP pages as well as our extension as our View layer. 

### Entity
![](UMLDiagram/Entity.png)  
We have these classes mapping to the schema in Database. And this two classes provided a interface `JASONable`, to generate a JSON object as a response to request from extension. We also have our business logic here.

### DAO
![](UMLDiagram/DAO.png)  
BaseDAO is a generic class. It can manage databse connect session and transaction, and it realized **CRUD** methods.   
Other 4 DAO classes inherit from the corresponding class instance of BaseDAO (e.g. `UserDAO` extends `BaseDAO<User>`). They are all singleton and we ensured they are **thread-safe**. Some other methods that involved with database query are added into these classes. When using **HQL** to make query, named parameter is used to **prevent databse from SQL injection**.  

### webAPP
In webAPP package there are servlets and filters. A **CharcterEncodingFilter** is deployed to ensure the character encodings of all requests and responses are **UTF-8**. Servlets process requests and return responses.

## Component design
### Detect achievement
Once selecting a area of word, the method of `/newRecord` is called. The method of GET is called, and the parameter `word` is the content of the selected word. Text-transform and space are both available.  

This interface changes all words to lowercase, and processes match and analysis by using regular expression. If the selected word is available, this word is added into the record of searching. If it is a long sentence, it would not add in the history. In a word, the user could get scores if the word exists, and new achievements are checked whether the user can get. If users can get new achievements, the format of returned value is `json`. 

### Sign in/Log in/Log out
- **sign in**  
Once a user fills out the enrollment form, and clicks the button of `sign in`, the method of `/Signin`  is called, and if the user registers successfully, the related information is saved in the session, passed while dispatching a request and calling the method of `Login`. Thereinto, in order to make sure the username is unique to maintain the consistence of the database, the method of `/checkUsername` is called to check whether the username is available to register.

- **log in**  
while logging in, the method of `/Login` is called. If the request is from plugin, the parameter `extension` is `true`, else this key isn't needed. Besides, the returned value is `true` while logging in successfully, otherwise it is `false`, if the request is from plugin. 

- **log out**  
 If the user tempts to log out, the method of `/Logout` is called. If the request is from plugin, the parameter `extension` is `true`, else this key isn't needed. 

- **Send E-mail**  
While calling the method of `/newRecord`, if a new achievement is checked to be obtained, the function of `sendCongratulation(user, achievement)` is applied to send an e-mail via SMTP server. We send the emails to the users with the SMTP service provided by **Mailgun**.

## Database design
![](UMLDiagram/ERD.png)  

- Three extra attribute **wordSum**, **scoreSum** and **score** are added to User, to reduce cost of getting the score, the times of user making a search, and the total amount of achievements the user has got.  
- In table **Achievement** there is a attrubute "type" to decide what kind of achievement it is, how the system read value of `condition` and `condition2`, and to decide how the system judges whether a user has got this achievement. In this way, system administrator can add achievements to the database more flexibly.

# Appendix
## Appendix 1: Achievement logic
Achievement items are saved in the database in order to add new achievement or update existed ones.  The logic of achievement judging is listed as followed:  

- **wordsum**  
	The achievement is related to the sum of words, which are searched via GoCheer achievement system. In other word, users can get the specific achievement by having looked up a set amount of words.

- **specific word**  
	The achievement is related to some specific words, such as 'Naive', 'Excited' and 'Java'. Users can get the achievement when they exactly select the specific word set in the system.

- **day**  
	The achievement can be get when users look up some word on a specific day, which is set according to what day it is. For example, the users can get the "Friday" achievement, when they look up a word on Friday.

- **date**  
	The achievement can be get when users look up some word on a specific day, which is set according to what the date it is. For example, the users can get the "Valentine" achievement when they look up a word on Feb 14th.

- **time**  
	The achievement can be get when users look up some word at a specific time. For example, the users can get the "Zero" achievement when they look up a word at 0 o'clock.

- **duration & repeat count**  
	The users can get this kind of achievement only when they repeat searching the same word during a certain period of time. For example, the user can get the "Amnesia" achievement when they repeat searching a word in one hour for ten times.

- **duration & wordsum**  
	The users can get this kind of achievement only when they have looked up a set amount of words during a certain period of time. For example, the user can get the "Loyal customer" achievement when they have looked up one hundred words in one hour.

- **repeat count**  
	The achievement can be get when users repeat searching a same word for a set amount of times. For example. users can obtain the "Amentia" achievement when they have looked up a same word for one hundred times.

- **day & time**  
	The achievement is related to the concept of day and time. Users only can get the definite achievements when they select a word at a specific time and on a specific day. For example, the user can get the "Lonely" achievement when they look up a word at 22 o'clock on Friday.

- **date & wordsum**  
	The achievement is related to the date and the sum of words. Users can get the accord achievement when they have looked up a set amount of words on a specific day. For example, Users can get the "Dreary" achievement when they have searched 100 words on Feb 14th, the Valentine Day.

- **date & time**  
	The achievement is related to date and time. Users can get the accord achievement when they search a word at a specific time and on a set day. For example, users can get the "Eve" achievement when users select a word at 0 o'clock on Jan 1.

- **date & specific word**  
	The achievement can be get when users look up the specific word on a set day. For example, users can get "Dreary" achievement when they have looked up one hundred words on Feb 14th, the Valentine Day.
